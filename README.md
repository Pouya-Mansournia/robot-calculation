# robot-calculation
Robot Calculation is a software based on Java language for static calculations of many mobile robots for researchers working in robotics. Using this software can solve mathematical problems. The amount of torque and motor velocity required using the inputs of slope and number. Wheels and motors are easily obtained and do not involve solving complex mechanical calculations. This software can calculate the necessary torque to move the robotic arm in the second section, along with the amount of battery consumption for the operation of the device.
I first developed this software in Excel. I concluded, why not turn this calculation into an android application and make it available to the public so that they can easily use this software as well. I have used the output of this software for many years in robotic projects. It has had a very good result in the process of quickly solving static and dynamic mechanical formulas.
